# ReGSP

## A visualized application for homology-based gene searching and plotting using multiple reference sequences

A multiple-Referenceâ€“based Gene Search and Plot (ReGSP) is a simple and convenient web tool that accepts multiple reference sequences for homology-based gene search. The tool incorporates cPlot, a novel dot plot tool, for illustrating nucleotide sequence similarity between the query and the reference sequences.
